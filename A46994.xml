         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS I am well aſſured and many can witneſs that the <hi>Surey</hi> Affair was at firſt laid before me by a ſpecial hand of Providence without ſeeking it, or my Self in it: So was I by the ſame Hand of God led through it from firſt to laſt. It is alſo apparent to ſeveral, both in City and Country, that a Narrative of the Caſe and our Carriage in it, was called for by Perſons of great Note in order to their Satisfaction: That thereupon I drew up my ſhort plain Account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, extracted out of my Minutes all along, according to mine own certain Obſervation and others credible Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>When it was urged that it would not ſatisfy unleſs there was Proof, and that upon Oath, as to Matter of Fact; I was neceſſitated for the clearing of the Truth and of our Selves; to gather up Informations, which are Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Affidavits, before ſuch as were unprejudiced and would adminiſter an Oath in the caſe.</p>
            <p>As to the Printing of the Narrative at all, the Sollicitations of ſeveral Worthy Perſons were the occaſion, and the <hi>Reflections</hi> in a certain <hi>Book,</hi> call'd <hi>the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:57247:3"/>Devil turn'd Caſuiſt,</hi> I confeſs did haſten it's Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing: but I did not conſent to the Publiſhing of it as all, but according to the Authentick Copy, and with the Approbation of ſeveral noted <hi>London</hi>-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters their nominated. Therefore I muſt not undertake in vindicate the Printed Edition as it's publiſhed, much leſs every particular Paſſage in it: I muſt leave that to theſe who are immediately concerned. The Typogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Errors and the not adding of the <hi>Errata's</hi> will be eaſily excused as to the Editor by the ingenuous.</p>
            <p>As to the ſubſtantial part of the printed Narrative concerning Matter of Fact, I muſt ſtill own it how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: Tho it doth not ſo much affect me whether it prove a Poſſeſſion, and ſo a Diſpoſſeſſion or no; for my main ends are very much attain'd through the good Hand of God upon us as I humbly hope: Not but that I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive it was a Poſſeſſion (and ſo a Diſpoſſeſſion) or as the <hi>Ancients</hi> call it an <hi>Obſeſſion.</hi> That the Ancients own'd Poſſeſſion under the Term of Obſeſſion is plain from <hi>Juſtin Martyr, in oratione ad Gent. p. 88. Cyprian p. 70 and 166. Edit. Pamel.</hi> The Centuriators 4th <hi>Cent. p. 419, 440.</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> on <hi>Mat. 17.21.</hi> owns faſting and praying as the means of diſpoſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſing.</p>
            <p>If any ask what thoſe ends were, I anſwer that the miſerable Creature might be delivered from the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Malady which he was under, whether Spiritual or Corporal, and by what means lawful ſoever to be uſed: It's evident that this end is attained, for as to his bodily
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:57247:3"/>Condition, he's heal'd; and better I hope as to his Spiritual Condition.</p>
            <p>Another great end was, that we might take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſerve the ſaving good of thoſe Multitudes that reſorted to the Meetings upon this occaſion: However that it might be a Testimony for God and againſt the Impenitent; this end we hope is in ſome meaſure attain'd alſo. Whilſt we approve our Hearts to the All-ſeeing God, and appeal to him as All judging, let none be cenſorious, nor judg before the time, leſt attempting to ſtep into his Tribunal, they haſten and aggravate their own Judgement: Yet are we of thoſe who acknowledge our Infirmity as well as profeſs our Integrity before God and Man. <hi>Veniam petimus dabimuſque viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we did drive at ſuch holy and bleſſed ends, the Sermons preached on the occaſion will manifeſt, which Sermons my Reverend and Ingenious Neighbour Mr. <hi>R. W.</hi> thought might be more to Edification than the Diſcourſes in the printed Narrative: Which Sermons may ſee the Light if it be judged convenient, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
            <p>In all this we are greatly concerned to look to our Hearts and ſee what Spirit we are of, to look to our way and how we walk in it, that we be led by ſound Judgment rather than fond Affection; by unfeigned Faith rather than fooliſh Fancy, in theſe things. Far be it from any to ſhut their Eyes againſt the Evidence, and to harden their Hearts againſt the Power of Truth,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:57247:4"/>which ſome may be tempted unto from a Spirit of Envy againſt the Perſons concerned, if not from a Spirit of Malignity againſt the good ways of God: Others may be tempted unto from a Spirit of Sadduciſm and Atheiſm which now works powerfully in the Children of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or Unperſwadableneſs. Yea God forbid that on either hand we ſhould any of us give ahvantage to the common Adverſaries of the great Truths and good Ways of Chriſtianity; or that we ſhould expoſe our ſelves and each other to humour them and make them ſport. If there have been any thing hereof in any who are concerned in theſe matters, ſure they have cauſe to be humbled for it and to take ſhame to themſelves: If any do think that we kept not within our Province, let them take notice that not to ſuccour in ſuch like caſes is to ſlay: Mar. <hi>3.4.</hi> We cordially pity, ſolemnly pray for thoſe who are not of our particular Communion, as we have occaſion. Here was Miſery, ſo the object of our Mercy, <hi>Luk. 10.33.</hi> according to that caſe Mar. <hi>9.22.</hi> They cried to us that <hi>if we could do any thing, we would have compaſſion on them and help them.</hi> Other Means failing them and other Perſons neglecting them.</p>

Yet I ſhall be ſo ingenuous as to give it him now under my hand that it ſeems probable to me, according to all the Indications I meet with in approved Authors, on that Subject, that it was a Poſſeſſion, or an Obſeſſion, as commonly called: For what more probable ſigns thereof can any one aſſign? Yea may I not modeſtly ſay that there ſeem'd to be as many ſigns of Poſſeſſion, or Obſeſſion, as in moſt, if not in any, of thoſe recorded in the Evangelick Hiſtory?

               <p>
                  <hi>That this doth any way diſadvantage the cauſe of revealed Religion,</hi> I underſtand not; for we give that Glory to divine Miracles which our Bleſſed Lord did in his own, and his extraordinary Miniſters did in his name, that they were wrought not only in the immediate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of what might poſſibly in proceſs of time be done by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Means (as when he cured Feavors), but of what could not be done by any means but by his own Divine Power (as when he raiſed the dead, gave ſight to thoſe born blind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) This I ſuggeſt to ſhew upon what Baſis true Miracles do ſtand: But that any Impoſture is foiſted in, or that there are clearer Indications of Poſſeſſion in all or any of thoſe ſtiled Demoniacks in the Goſpel is yet unproved, ſo that we firmly believe the Goſpel Revelation of the Miracles, and the Confirmation thereof thereby: And as to Demoniacks (and Diſpoſſeſſions in particular; tho the Poſſeſſion might be <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diante morbo, (viz.</hi> through Lunacy or a Mania) yet it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly immediate ſometimes, as in the <hi>Pythoniſs, Acts</hi> 16. and ſo we ſuppoſe in this caſe.</p>

What a difference then is there of Times and Means? At the firſt it was a greater work to diſpoſſeſs Devils by Prayer and Faſting than by Command; now it's far greater to do it by a meer Command than by Prayer and Faſting: That which was then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily done would be now ſtrangely miraculous, and that which is in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe now was then rare and unuſual: The Power of an adjuring Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand we ſee ceaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Power of fervent Prayer can never be out of date. This and this only is the remedy of both bodily and mental Poſſeſſion: Thus if we will reſiſt the Devil he ſhall flee away from us: Now upon the ground of the Scripture it was (AS MY SELF WAS WITNESS) that in our Age, Mr.</hi> Darrel <hi>a Godly and Zealous Preacher, undertook and accordingly through the Bleſſing of God upon his faithful Devotion perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe famous Ejectments of Evil Spirits both at</hi> Nottingham <hi>and</hi> Lancaſhire, <hi>which exercis'd the Preſs and raiſed no ſmall Envy from the Gainſayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57247:5"/>
               <p>Before we enter upon the examination of Particulars, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe three things which anſwer to the threefold deſign of Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Book.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whereas <hi>he would ſometimes have</hi> Dugdale<hi>'s ſtrange Fits to be the Effects of ſome bodily Diſeaſe, as Epilepſy or Convulſion,</hi> the Party not only utterly and ſolemnly denies any ſuch bodily Diſeaſe before, as the natural cauſe of the ſaid Fits; but the contrary cannot be proved, nor is it attempted: that his Body was diſtemper'd by the Fits, and had relief by Phyſick afterward, is all along acknowledg'd, but various Effects muſt needs give place to their ſeveral proper Cauſes: He had no ſuch Diſeaſe before to be the cauſe of ſuch Fits. What Diſtemper he had after was plainly the Effect of his ſaid ſtrange Fits. <hi>Idem non pateſt eſſe cauſa &amp; effectus ejuſdem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That whereas Mr. <hi>T. would otherwhile have the buſineſs to be a cheat,</hi> (for he knows not on whether to ſix) here alſo not only the Parties immediatly concerned do utterly and ſolemnly deny it, but the Teſtimonies as to Matter of Fact, do demonſtrate the contrary, when Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and all his Accomplices have done their utmoſt; the Witneſſes the not at all tampered with, do ſtill ſtand to their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and upon further tryal may ſo explain themſelves, as to put the Caſe further beyond all diſpute: So do the Parties immediately concerned, they ſtill perſiſt in their diſclaiming any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>T. ſays their was a Popiſh Combination:</hi> Here again thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concerned do not only utterly and ſolemnly deny it, but the <hi>Proofs to the contrary</hi> are altogether deficient as to Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s <hi>deſign of a Combination</hi> with the Papiſts. As to any Combination among the Papiſts I know nothing: I leave that to Mr. <hi>T. to find out,</hi> who doth ſo vainly boaſt of <hi>his Talent in diſcovering ſuch Intriegues.</hi> As to <hi>us Diſſenters, himſelf clears us from having any hand in the Contrivance,</hi> only he would fain have us to be the <hi>Papiſts diminutive <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderlings and their Fools.</hi> As to the <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s it's not denied, but diſcovered by us that the Popiſh Prieſts would have been tampering with them: Yea, it may be the poor ignorant People might in their great Diſtreſs, and through their Infirmity have a Tempatation, when they ſaw not the deſired Succeſs ſo ſoon as they expected, to ſeek to ſuch unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Means, as they had ſought to other unlawful Means before, and as one King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did indeed run to the <hi>Witch</hi> at <hi>Endor,</hi> another ſent to the God of <hi>Ekron;</hi> but theſe <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s did afterward decline ſuch Temptations, and do ſtill diſclaim any <hi>Combination with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> in this caſe. Can a meer Sollicitation by the Tempter be call'd

               </p>
               <p>Let Mr. <hi>T.</hi> alſo at preſent take notice of what may be obvious to any one in this particular caſe, in reference to what Mr. <hi>T.</hi> with his Teſtimonies, ſay thereupon.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57247:8"/>
               <p>Tho the caſe be otherwiſe ſolved, yet let us ſay ſomething as to what Mr. <hi>T.</hi> alledgeth <hi>from the Phyſitians,</hi> and would thence prove <hi>D</hi>'s Fits to be an <hi>Epilepſy, Convulſtion,</hi> or the like.</p>
               <p>As to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> the Inſtances brought out of him; all together do not near reach this caſe: Beſides the Doctor doth not deny Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in ſome of them: Neither doth he according to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us the means of their Cure.</p>
               <p>As to Dr. <hi>Radcliffs Letter to Mr. T.</hi> upon this occaſion the Doctor is not very ingenuous in <hi>ſaying that the Non-conformiſts do engroſs any thing to themſelves in this caſe:</hi> For if he do but peruſe Mr. <hi>Burton</hi>'s <hi>Collections under this Head,</hi> he may have his anſwer.</p>
               <p>And as to our averring that the Devil ſometimes tells the truth, the Doctor, if he be well acquainted with the Scripture of Truth, may eaſily find ſeveral Inſtances, both in the Goſpels and in the Acts, to ſhew that the Devil ſometimes ſpeaks great Truths tho he be forced to it, and beſure ſpeaks them for no good end. The truth is many in this Age are more Atheiſtical than the Devil himſelf, as wicked as he is, for he believes a God to make him tremble — he profeſſeth Chriſt in his deſperate way — he makes uſe of Scripture Words and Truths to pervert them.</p>
               <p>As to Dr. <hi>R</hi>'s Inſtance out of <hi>Galen, concerning the fore knowledg of his Fit,</hi> it's nothing to the purpoſe, for <hi>D</hi>'s fore-telling was in the fore-going Fit, and not when the preſent Fit was coming on him: this latter is eaſy enough in ſeveral ordinary natural Diſtempers: But why doth he not bring us one Inſtance in that caſe of a Perſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in ſo many Fits exactly fore-telling the time of the following Fit, and ſtill hitting; his Fit being greater or leſſer? His telling and fore-telling other things alſo, the Doctor doth wholly wave; this is not fair dealing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Teſtimony out of Leiſelius</hi> doth not come up to this caſe: Had the <hi>Doctor haa the Surey Informations by him,</hi> and conſulted them, he might have ſeen it, to be, as I ſay.</p>
               <p>His account as to <hi>D</hi>'s Gravity and Levity in the ſame Fit ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ridiculous; for both were in the ſame dead Fit, and he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſaid Fit a conſiderable time after the Witneſſes had ſeveral times tried his weight: This many Perſons do teſtify upon Oath, and others inform to the ſaid purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I think we may challenge all the Doctors in <hi>England,</hi> to bring us a ſingle Inſtance, out of any approved Author any ſuch, under a meer natural Diſeaſe; to parallel the caſe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Pag. </seg>41</label> As to the Marginal Notes upon the Affidavits, I muſt mind the Reader, that the Witneſſes Teſtimony upon their Oath muſt needs carry the cauſe: Beſides I ſuppoſe there will be nothing found in the Informations at <hi>Darwin</hi> that interfereth with the Affidavits at <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb.</hi> I cannot but obſerve how little notice Mr. <hi>T.</hi> take of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <hi>Egerton,</hi> who fate with Mr. <hi>Braddil</hi> at <hi>Darwin,</hi> it may be it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he afterward joined with the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> at <hi>Holcomb.</hi> Let it be here alſo noted, that the moſt of the Witneſſes as well as <hi>D</hi>'s whole Family are Conformiſts, which doth rather advantage our cauſe; for otherwiſe Mr. <hi>T.</hi> might have had more colour to ſuſpect us of ſome ſelſiſh deſign, which we carryed on by and among our ſelves; Beſides if they be Cheats and Falſe-witneſſes why are they not dealt with accordingly, if there be any Diſcipline among thoſe of that Communion? They do indeed confeſs a want of the Primitive Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>
               <p>There was the ſtrangeneſs of the <hi>Stone's paſſage through his Jaws and Throat, that it ſhould only cauſe ſome ſtreaks of Blood:</hi> Yet that it was ſo voided, the Oath confirms: <hi>That it was not poſſible in an ordinary way Dr.</hi> B. <hi>acknowledgeth:</hi> Therefore there was a cauſe extraordinary, ſome inviſible Power.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Too.

Should we tell of our ſecret as well as open Agonies, about this Affair, it would not be well taken by ſome, and it's no Pleaſure to me to ſpeak of them.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57247:10"/>I am ſure that young <hi>D.</hi> did then own the Spiritual means, as the means whereby he had this help, and deſired the continuing of the uſe thereof, as there was occaſion; and they were ſo. <hi>That he ſaid his Son anſwered him he could not tell what his Diſtemper was, nor how it came:</hi> This ſeems to me to evince that it was no ſuch Combination nor Cheat, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would have it to be.

               <p>The diſingenuity of Father and Son were not both at the ſame time, elſe it's likely we had deſiſted, and good reaſon for it, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly as to the Father; for tho the place was licenſed, it was not fit we ſhould intrude our ſelves, and obtrude our labour; they cry out in a pang of impatience that <hi>they got no good by us,</hi> as if we could do it by our own power, little looking to God, and to their Duty; no marvel he exerciſed them with ſuch delay and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whilſt they were ſo unprepar'd for the Mercy: Surely things and times, are in the Lord's Hand, not in ours.

(which in that Fit he ſaid muſt be his laſt) but our Spiritual Means were before the laſt Fit. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is likely to be the means of his Cure, that which went before his laſt Fit, or that which followed? Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s charge of <hi>our vain Ambition, and ſiniſter Aim</hi> is moſt cenſorious (it's well if there prove not a Beam in his own Eye to be caſt out) it's high time for me to be dead to all ſuch things.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>our letting the Narrative ſleep, until thoſe Gentlemen were in their Graves, as if we ſuffer'd it to be ſo upon ſuch a deſign,</hi> it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among the many other of Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Falſehoods and Calumnies.</p>
               <p>What doth Dr. <hi>C</hi>'s Certificate ſignify? Not only that it was after the Fits left <hi>D.</hi> but here is not one Witneſs to the Certificate; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he only ſaith, <hi>that his Phyſick had good ſucceſs,</hi> which we deny not in its place and time; and <hi>for that afterwards obſerving my direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as Dr. <hi>C.</hi> ſaith, he never ſince had any more Fit. It's pitty the Doctor is not alive to explain and prove the Inference; but that it's left to ſuch a one as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to do it: I think Dr. <hi>Chew,</hi> (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Edward Chew</hi> as he ſtiles himſelf) as bad a name as he went under among many as to ſome things, yet he would have been more candid than Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Becauſe he lays ſuch ſtreſs on this Certificate: Let me a little Syllogize upon it, and ſee whether there be not a groſs <hi>non ſequitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall prove that Dr. <hi>C.</hi> did not the Cure: (is it not rather a meer trick to elude the right means, to pretend that Dr. <hi>Chew</hi> did the Cure?)</p>
               <p>If the Cure, as to <hi>D</hi>'s Fits, was effected upon the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Chew</hi> gave him not Phyſick till the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> then <hi>Dr. Chew</hi>'s Phyſick did not effect the Cure; but the firſt is thue: therefore the latter; that he was freed upon the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> is fully teſtified; that he took not the Phyſick till the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> is freely confeſſed. Here take notice that <hi>D.</hi> in his Fits did tell he muſt be killed, or cured, before the ſaid <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>March:</hi> Obſerve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo how politickly the Gentlemen order'd it to give <hi>D.</hi> the Phyſick, juſt when the Term was expired, and after his laſt Fit.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:57247:15"/>
               <p n="2">2. That Dr. <hi>C</hi>'s Phyſick could not cure him at all, as poſſeſs'd which is here ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>Where there is no proper Vehicle, as to natural cauſes to conveigh the evil Spirit into him, there can be no Phyſical Means to diſlodg it: But here was no proper Vehicle, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dugdale</hi> was not Melancholly, which is called, <hi>Vehiculum Deaboli,</hi> nor Lunatick, nor Epileptick, before the ſaid ſtrange Fits: If there was any of theſe, or any other Diſtemper afterward, it was rather the Effect of his ſtrange Fits, than any way the cauſe thereof. As to his <hi>Boyiſh Tricks</hi> and Childiſh Fancies, moſt of which he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily denies, theſe were long before, and prove nothing to the purpoſe. The Tricks he is charged with, when he was a School-Boy, are not only denied by himſelf, but by other of his School-Fellows.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Spiritual Means were the only Means of his Cure, as to his ſtrange Fits. I prove thus,</p>
               <p>The Means muſt needs go before the End, as to Execution; but theſe Spiritual Means were the only Means that went before the ſaid Cure, therefore — <hi>finis eſt prior in intentione, poſterior in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Let it be remembred all along, that tho Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is pleaſed to call us the <hi>Papiſts Tools,</hi> yet withal he confeſſeth <hi>that we would not give way, that they ſhould handle us nor the</hi> D<hi>'s neither:</hi> So that there was no great danger of the Papiſts doing any harm by us, as their Tools. But let Mr. <hi>T</hi> beware how he meddles with <hi>edged Tools,</hi> or rather in Scripture-Phraſe, how he <hi>kicks againſt the Pricks.</hi> Indeed Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Ignorance and Infidelity, as in the Apoſtles caſe, may by ſome be taken as an Extenuation of the Fault of his furious Zeal; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. Yet others will take it as an Aggravation thereof, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we conſider whoſe Son he was, and what Education he had.</p>
               <p>I wonder what Mr. <hi>T.</hi> means, by our <hi>having moſt Plots, and the worſt luck in Plotting that ever Men had</hi> Have we had more Plots and worſe Succeſs than the Papiſts? Was there in all his remembrance any but that of the Meal-Tub, and will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> vindicate that to be a Presbyterian Plot.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57247:16"/>
               <p>I pray Sir, what Plot have any others diſcover'd, or what <hi>Talent have you to boaſt of, as to further Diſcoveries,</hi> unleſs it be of your own folly? Let not him that puts on his Armour boaſt as he that puts it off. If you <hi>had as good a Talent at diſcloſing Secrets as the</hi> Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack <hi>had in his Fits,</hi> it will not be for your credit. In that you call <hi>D</hi>'s <hi>Devil our Friend,</hi> you too much diſcover the Spirit you are acted by. I pray what friendſhip did the Devil ſhew us, or we him? Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will ſay the Devil was not in <hi>D.</hi> I wiſh he be not entered into, if ever he went out of others, in a worſe Senſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not envy Mr. <hi>T.</hi> the excellency of his Talent, in belching forth his venemous Rancour againſt us, in his preamble to his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>diſcovery of the Combination,</hi> nor ſhall I much heed the reproaches he would caſt upon us; for by this time, neither his Tongue, nor his Pen, will be accounted a Slander.</p>
               <p>To call us <hi>the conſtant Tools of Propery,</hi> when it is ſo well known by the many Popiſh Plots, that the Papiſts have made uſe of another ſort of Tools, as ſome of Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s own Communion have ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd: Whenas ſuch Champions as <hi>Ames, Baxter, Owen, Pool,</hi> and many more have ſo well acquitted themſelves againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; and whenas it's ſo well known how much of the Non Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts Arguments, is made uſe of againſt Popery: So that the Non Conformiſts have as good Hands, and better Tools againſt the Papiſts. If the <hi>diſtinction of Obſeſſion from Poſſeſſion, be uſed among the Papiſts;</hi> is ever, diſtinction among Papiſts, a Popiſh Diſtinction? The Truth is, both Ancient and Modern Writers only make uſe of the Term Obſeſſion as more proper.</p>
               <p>Doth not the afor ſaid Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> Vye with his Antagoniſts upon this Point, as may be ſeen in his Life? <hi>Is it any diſadvantage to the Proteſtant Intereſt, if there be ſuch a Power in</hi> the uſe of lawful means <hi>among us?</hi> What Glory is therein the contrivance of ſuch a Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be emulous, if there be ſuch a Combination according to Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Pretentions? Are we not much beholding to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> that he will <hi>excuſe us from being the orignal Authors of the pretenaed Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but who can vield to his reaſonleſs Reaſons?</p>
               <p>Might we not have been <hi>cunning enough to combine,</hi> tho we had no more Learning than the <hi>D</hi>'s, who are pretended to be in the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Who will queſtion Mr. <hi>Carrington</hi>'s Ability to reply upon the Demon either in Greek or Latin, if they knew him? But that he thought it not convenient to diſcourſe him in another Language, as the Prieſt did for the reaſon aſſedged. I would the two Maſters of Art might try Maſteries in any of the Arts (tho Mr. <hi>T.</hi> may be the Seniour) to clear it, that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath more Learning than Mr. <hi>T.</hi> can
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57247:16"/>gueſs at by the Narrative. Some of Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Brethren might have ſatisfied him as to Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s Learning. O how is Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ready to burſt with his fullneſs of that Spirit which dwells in him, whereby he had conceived us to be <hi>the diminutive <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderling-Slaves, to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in the Farce,</hi> as he calls it. <hi>Parturiunt montes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note that our diſproving of a Combination, in Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Sence, is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundanti;</hi> for it's the Poſſeſſion that we defend: And we are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from having any hand in the pretended Combination.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s <hi>1ſt</hi> Ground for his ſuppoſed Combination, it will prove Sandy, whether in reference to what himſelf or Dr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith. For from <hi>T. D</hi>'s <hi>having been a Papiſt and his Children having been Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly brought up,</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> might as reaſonably and charitably have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, that the Papiſts would never entruſt ſuch a ſuppoſed Intreague, in the hands of ſuch, who had proved ſo unfaithful to them, and who have approved themſelves true Proteſtants ever ſince. But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is apt to take things by the wrong handle. And as to the conſideration of <hi>the then Scene of Publick Affairs,</hi> it's probable theſe poor People in that blind Corner, were very far from ſuch Policies, which might better beſeem thoſe who would ſecure their beneficial places, or ſought great things for themſelves: Theſe were more likely to ingratiate themſelves with thoſe, who then had got the Aſcendant.</p>
               <p>Who this Dr. <hi>B.</hi> is I know not, nor is there any ones word to witneſs that theſe words were his; however he's made to ſpeak ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> but why ſhould any be bound to believe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of they know not who, when the accuſed had no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to anſwer for themſelves, As ignorant as the <hi>D</hi>'s are, I doubt not but they are ready to anſwer to any, who will buſy themſelves to ask them of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Tho I am not ſo immediately concerned as to the <hi>2d</hi> Ground Mr. <hi>T.</hi> lays for a ſuppoſed Combination, yet muſt I take notice how he calls the <hi>Diſſenters, the Papiſts conſtant Apes in ſuch Juggles,</hi> as before he call'd us <hi>their conſtant Tools.</hi> Who would think that Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a Diſſenter, but he's dead, and forgotten too. It's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, <hi>It's an ill Bird that bewrayes its own Neſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am not, neither are my Reverend Brethren accountable, neither for the Typographical Errors, nor for thoſe Miſtakes that were in the uncorrected Copy; which, through I know not whoſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is printed: The ſame I muſt ſay for my Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>C.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57247:17"/>Eminently Learned Academick, Mr. <hi>R. F.</hi> he was but once at the <hi>Surey,</hi> nor ſo much as once did ſee the Narrative (that I know of) that is printed, as it's printed, before it was printed. I will here alſo, by the way, do Mr. <hi>Rinſhaw</hi> the right to tell the World, that he was but once at the <hi>Surey</hi>-Meeting upon the ſaid occaſion, and there were ſome ſmall miſtakes in the uncorrect Copy, which he took notice of, and ſhould have been corrected. I wiſh the <hi>Surey</hi>-Book had had the Errata's annexed.</p>
               <p>My Brethren who are more immediately concerned, are of age to anſwer for themſelves, and when the worſt is made of it, that Pride and Malice can make of it, what is this to prove Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s <hi>Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> but only whilſt he, in his malevolent way, would, with the Devil clear us from Forgery; yet muſt he trample on his Betters for ſome inculpable, at leaſt pardonable weakneſſes; as where Mr. <hi>T.</hi> upbraids Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſo baſely with the natural Infirmities in his Sight, or other Infirmities. I have tried <hi>D.</hi> and find him altogether a Stranger to thoſe Latin and Greek Sentences which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>C.</hi> alledg as ſpoken in his Fit. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> might have tried him too, had he been ſo ingenuous.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not henceforth give my ſelf, and the Reader that needleſs trouble as to follow Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in his Meandrous Paſſages, towards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Papiſtical Combination, it would be a laborious loſs of time on our part, as his is labour in vain: for I hope to cut the work ſhorter, and to clear all fully before Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and I part, if it be not done already.</p>

               <p>As to the Paſſage of <hi>D</hi>'s <hi>being Dumb and Deaf ſo long,</hi> I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Truth before, and I was likelier to know the Truth, the Paper being delivered to me; that he ſometimes was ſenſible out of his Fit, of what was in his Fit, is not denied; but we affirm that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily he was not ſenſible: See as to this <hi>Origen. de Principiis</hi> cap. 3.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>the Reſerves</hi> that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> pretends to, and threatens us with, (through the Grace of God) I fear them not at all, nor any thing that any one can ſay or do, in this caſe, as to me. I hope I am on a ſure bottom, and under a ſtrong guard; ſo that I need not fear this Shock, after all the reſt.</p>
               <p>As to all that impudent inſolent Language, which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> gives us, in the cloſe of this Page: I do humbly, and meekly, yet cordially, and confidently retort it upon himſelf, as Arrows ſhot againſt a Brazen-Wall: <hi>Religion is not abuſed by us,</hi> but by himſelf; we are not an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious deſigning Party, whatever he is: We could have ſate down content ſooner or later, if Providence had not led us from firſt to laſt: We have not ſeen our ſelves baffled, neither in danger of it, by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimi Conatus,</hi> the dying Efforts of ſuch Men; we can through Chriſt ſtrengthening us, hold up our Heads in the World: Yea, lay down our Heads in Peace, and lift up our Heads before the Judg of all at laſt: (Tho he may do ſomewhat towards judging in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even in this World) it is no Spirit of Infatuation nor Vanity that led me to, and through this work, ſo far as I am concerned; and I ſhould know the Spirit of Chriſt as well as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Surely I do know my ſelf better than he knows me; it was neither Wickedneſs, nor Weakneſs, that concerned me thus far: I ſuppoſe that to all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſober Perſons it will be chargeable elſewhere, it is no <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Popiſh piece of Prieſt craft,</hi> on our part beſure: At other times Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will rather judg us to be too far from Superſtition and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, both Name and Thing, we may alſo retort upon him his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57247:22"/>Terms of audacious Wickedneſs, the ſcarce to be parallel'd Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a young ſcoſſing <hi>Iſhmacl:</hi> It is Mr. <hi>T.</hi> that the <hi>Inconſiſtencies and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths</hi> will be found with, upon peruſal of our reply and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the caſe further: That the Father of Lies doth ſometimes tell the Truth, as <hi>Doeg</hi> did of <hi>David,</hi> tho for an evil End, and the Lord turns all againſt himſelf as appears in the Goſpel-Hiſtory: That we do not credit Satan any further than we have it conſirmed other Ways, or by the Event. <hi>That there is no affront to God Almighty, or Preſumptnous attributing that to his Spirit, and his Ordinances, which is wholly owing to the Sins and Chea's of Men: Neither is there baſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerities, nor lying Legends and Forgeries, nor a Spirit of Fanaticiſm and Diviſion ſanctified with Prayer and Faſting.</hi> The Lord is coming to execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of their ungodly Deeds, which they have ungodly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and of all their <hi>hard Speeches</hi> which they have ſpoken againſt him. We have ſome of us ſeen ſomething in our time of the Lord's handling ſuch Sons of <hi>Zerviah,</hi> or Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> even in this World. <hi>Lege Hiſtoriam ne ſis hiſtoria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I only ſay the Lord rebuke the foul Spirit in this Man, and the Lord give him Repentance: Elſe I am afraid the Lord will ſoon reckon with him for what he doth ſay, and would do. It's not the <hi>warmth of Fancy,</hi> but pious Zeal, it's not the bare Opinion, but good Aſſurance, that we ſerve God: It's not Will-worſhip, but Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-worſhip: However, Surely they are not the groſleſt Miſtakes, the worſt of Errors, and the vileſt Superſtitions, that are poſſible for Chriſtians to be enſnared in, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would have them to be. How is this Man even burſting aſunder (without any Provocation) and falling headlong with his Rage and Rancour; the Lord judg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, as to the cauſe: Yet let him not enter into Judgment with, to proceed in Execution thereof upon, the Offenders.</p>
               <p>We acted according to the Meaſure of Grace, and Gifts, that we have received; whereof we dare not, will not boaſt; but as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with the conforming Clergy, we muſt needs differ from them in this, as in other things, if they preach ſuch Doctrine as M. <hi>T.</hi> did in this Country: If we had conſulted them it's very likely they would have expected, that we alſo ſhould have paſſed by the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Man, on either ſide, as the Prieſt and Levite did, but he lay in our way, and we had Mercy on him: Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Popiſh Prieſts were playing a Game,</hi> it was ſoon at an end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our going to any, to learn to read, and underſtand the Papers which were vomited up by <hi>D.</hi> We need not fear Rivalſhip of thoſe,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57247:22"/>in ſuch a caſe, who deny all Poſſeſſions in latter Ages, or give us no Indications thereof: Nor of thoſe who are ſuch Strangers to the right uſe of Goſpel-Means in this caſe, and therefore ſet on ſoot Means of their own deviſing, as ſome have done of late, as I am credibly informed.</p>
               <p>For my part I am more ſatisfied in the thing than ever, ſince I have further enquired into it, ſince alſo I ſee with what a Spirit, in what a manner Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath managed the matter. As to our People alſo, they are better inſtructed, and ſpirited, than to give heed to ſuch raſh Heads, as Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s, who abandons himſelf to his unmortiſied Paſſions, and unbridled Expirſſions: Enough to turn the Spirit of any true Chriſtian againſt ſuch Men, and their Cauſe too.</p>
               <p>As to our Injudiciouſneſs, and Inſincerity, our People, who hear you ſometimes, and live amongſt you, who hear us ordinarily, and converſe ſo much with us, are likelier to judg in the caſe, than Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and ſuch like who I ſuppoſe never hear us, nor ſcarce know us at all: Yet theſe our People dare not adventure their precious and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls, under the way of Preaching, nor in the way of Living, which too many go in.</p>

                  </gap>rning the Church, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> doth, <hi>Laodicea</hi> like, ſo boaſt of, we do heartily acknowledg there have been many, and we hope are ſome of the Epiſcopal Perſwaſion, who are ſound, according to the true ſenſe and intent of the Doctrinal Part of the 39 Articles, who are of a right Chriſtian Temper, of a Holy Converſation, and are for Parochial Diſcipline, and Reformation: Theſe we honour and conſent with ſo far.</p>
               <p>But as to this Faction, who ſo vainly boaſt of their Purity, and Perfection, whenas the Lord Jeſus knows their works: Yea any one, even with half an Eye, if indeed open'd, may ſee, even by Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Scurrilous, Slanderous, Scandalous Pamphlet, and look no further, that they are wretched and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked: By this time of God and Religion: Yea have, by their implacable oppoſition to the Truth, and way of the Goſpel, with the Preachers, and the Profeſſors thereof, block't up, as much as in them lies, the Courſe of Reformation alſo, by their unfaithful Preaching, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Practiſe, with the countenancing ſuch as partake with them, how bad ſoever, have open'd the Flood-Gates to Atheiſm, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, conſequently to Superſtition and Idolatry, as woful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth teſtify beyond all contradiction.</p>
               <p>O that there were indeed ſuch a Zeal for revealed and real Religion, for Proteſtantiſm and Reformation, againſt Atheiſm
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57247:23"/>and Profaneneſs, Superſtition and Idolatry, as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>After all this I muſt ſolemnly profeſs, that ſuch an heap of groſs Lies, notorious Slanders, unworthy Inſinuations, reproachful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and baſe Language, did I, to my remembrance, never meet with, as in this Pamphlet of Mr. <hi>T</hi>s, and this againſt thoſe, who not only may I hope be reckon'd among the leaſt of Chriſt's little Ones, but who, through his Grace, have in ſome meaſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved themſelves as his Miniſters, according to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. to 11. ſo that my Heart akes, and I even tremble to think what guilt this Man hath loaden himſelf with, and what judgment he hath expoſed himſelf to, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6, 7. <hi>Luk</hi> 17.1, 2.</p>
               <p>The reſult of all as to the Caſe and it's Signs, the Cure and it's Means; Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s invidious, odious Repreſentations, of perſons and things, being waved, as meer Folly and Falſity; yea, wiped away as Filth, and Froth; too like that of the Demoniack in ſome of his Fits: I ſhall plainly and calmly expreſs my ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Negatively.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not to be denominated a <hi>Mania,</hi> or Diſtraction, a <hi>Spaſma,</hi> or <hi>Epilepſy, Convulſion,</hi> or any ſuch bodily Diſeaſe; tho there might ſeem ſometimes to be ſomething Symptomatical thereof: for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavits, and Informations, do plainly demonſtrate, that it was a further thing which continued after Mr. <hi>Chew</hi>'s firſt phyſicking him, and Mr. <hi>Crabtree</hi>'s ſecond phyſicking him ſo ſtrongly; which ſtrange Fits alſo were removed, before he took Mr. <hi>Chew</hi>'s Phyſick the latter time; obſerve here that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſaid that he would ride an 100 Miles to help him: Alſo that <hi>D.</hi> in ſeveral of his Fits ſaid, he might be kill'd or cured before the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>M.</hi> when Mr. <hi>C.</hi> gave him his Phyſick the latter time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It could not be any Art of Man, eſpecially in this <hi>D.</hi> for all who know him, muſt ſay that he is but of a very ordinary aptneſs, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as to Intellectuals, and not ſo much as of an ordinary Agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Activity, as to his Body. Any one would judg him very unſit as to the inventing of ſuch things, and a very bungler as to the acting of them</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither ought it to be called a Counterfeiting, or Cheat, to get Money, or for any other Siniſter End; ſeeing they are things that could not poſſibly be counterfeited; ſeeing alſo that it was ſo chargeable to them, whilſt they were under Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s Hands; alſo in the hireing of a continual Keeper, and other ways; ſeeing alſo that any ſuch Cheat is ſolemnly diſowned by the Parties concerned; as appeared before in the Informations, Affidavits, Certificate, which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57247:23"/>himſelf ſigned, and doth further appear. Beſides if the Gentlemen look't on it as a Cheat, why did they make uſe of Phyſicial Means? if they look't on it as a Diſeaſe, why did they threaten him?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor can it be juſtly charged to be any Combination amongſt the Parties themſelves, nor with the Papiſts: As to Combination with us, or amongſt us Diſſenters, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> himſelf, as little Charity as he hath for us, doth clear that. As to a Combination among the Parties themſelves or with the Papiſts; this is utterly diſowned by the <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s, nor is there any Proof of ſuch a Combination, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but meer Surmiſes, ſorry Suggeſtions. That there might be a Combination among the Popiſh Prieſts, before, or under the ſtrange Fits of <hi>D.</hi> is not denied; but their tampering with him is ſignihed in the Narrative. Now if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> who is ſo good at the diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch Intriegues, can make any thing of it, we have furniſhed him with ſomething to work on: Some of the Papiſts have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly expoſed for their Magical Charms, Sorceries, or Withcrafts moſt deſervedly, of which I doubt they have not repented, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Affimatively. To thoſe who have frequently ſeen, and heard <hi>D.</hi> in his Fits, it is more evident that it was a Diabolical Poſſeſſion, and that it was a righteous Judgment of God upon him, for his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and Debauched Life: But we cannot ſay, whether it was by the immediate Hand of God, or by Witchcraſt. Yet others, who did not hear him, and ſee him, as we did, are ſomething doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was a real Poſſeſſion: But the Signs of a Poſſeſſion, which Divines give, and the Teſtimony, as to Matter of Fact, do make this probable, at leaſt, as we think to thoſe who are unprejudiced, and unbiaſſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His telling, and foretelling of things in his Fits, which he could not poſſibly know by any ordinary mans. In his Fits he always, ſo far at we can learn, told when his next Fit would come, tho he had no external direction at all; yet ſtill his Fits came at that time exactly, as thoſe who had Watches, and obſerved, can aver in manifold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: He could tell of Perſons coming at a conſiderable diſtance, who they were; and whence they came; and what they did by the way; with many ſuch like Inſtances. Can thoſe who call this a Cheat, hire, or threaten him to the doing of theſe, and of the following Feats as formerly?</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Ability of Body in his Fits, beyond the Joint Strength of many Luſty Men: His Agility alſo, beyond any Art, he had at other times: Yea, beyond the Lawful Art of any other. Whenas his Ability was but ordinary, and his Agility leſs than ordinary, at other times.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:57247:24"/>
               <p n="3">3. The ſpeaking in him of another Voice, beſides his own, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeaking many Words, and Sentences, in which were Dental and Labial Letters, when he made no uſe of the Organs of Speech: Yea, two Voices at once have been heard from him, the one being of a very hideous ſound: And his words, as in his ordinary diſcourſe, diſtinctly heard at a Mile and a half diſtance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His being in the ſame Fit, one while as heavy as a Lump of Lead of that bigneſs, and other while as light as a Bag of Feathers of 14 or 16 Pound weight. Alſo as to the ſtiffneſs of his Body, it being inflexible in ſome part of his Fits, as a Bar of Iron, yea Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Senſeleſs, and Lifeleſs to others apprehenſion, for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His Diabolical Rage and Blaſphemy againſt God, and Chriſt, and the things of God, tho under no Feveriſh Frenzy that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; there being no ſuch Behaviour in him at other times: Yet would Satan ſometimes in his Fits, transform himſelf into an Angel of Light; yea, ſometimes in his Fit he would tell the Heads of a Sermon, that he never heard.</p>
               <p n="6">6. His ſpeaking ſeveral Languages, which he never learned, nor underſtood any thing of (tho at other times it ſeemed to be a ſort of Gibberiſh, to ſome of us; or a Language which the Hearets under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not) and ſometimes ſinging in Latin Verſe, whilſt in his Fits.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Sometimes ſomething like a Mouſe appearing about him, and in him, atiſing like the bigneſs of a Man's Fiſt, up and down under his Clothes; ſomething about the bigneſs of a little Dog in Bed with him, that was not one: Alſo the forcible riſing of the Lump and Voices out of it.</p>
               <p>As to this we may take notice of theſe Teſtimonies. <hi>King James the Firſt. Doemenol.</hi>

               </p>

                     </gap>uages, which the Patient never learned, and that with an uncouth hollow Voice; and all the time of his ſpeaking, a greater motion being in his Breaſt, than in his Mouth.</hi>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57247:24"/>ſpeak Languages they never learned; this puts it out of doubt, and queſtion, that they are not meer Mad-men, but Demoniacks. For Inſtances, ſee</hi> Pſellus, de oper. Daemon. <hi>Alſo</hi> Fernelius, de abditis, &amp;c. There are many other Inſtances of this kind, recorded by Modern Writers unexceptionable, of Perſons either wholly Daemoniacal, or ſo affected, or infected by them, as to have certain unuſual and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Symptoms; which for Brevity Sake we ſhall here omit.</p>
               <p>See alſo Mr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s <hi>Eſſay as to remarkable Providences, Chap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>So that other Symptoms of Poſſeſſions either muſt be found out, which are yet unknown to us, or theſe and more ſuch-like muſt be diſproved, which we think can never be done; or diabolical Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions muſt be utterly denied, which is ſo abſurd, that few but Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels (and Mr. <hi>T.</hi>) will ſo deny.</p>
               <p>As to the means of Cure.</p>
               <p>That this <hi>D.</hi> is delivered as to his outward Man, from this direful Judgment, we ſuppoſe none need to queſtion, being now freed from ſuch Fits for many Years. The only Queſtion now with ſome is, whether it was not a meer bodily Malady, and ſo ſome Purges or Vomits, which he took might be the means of his Cure.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould ſuppoſe that to be the caſe, yet Spiritual Means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much uſed withal, theſe muſt needs have the preference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians. And God muſt be acknowledged in all, as in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>'s Caſe. Surely Prayer had more Influence towards his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, than the Lump of Figs.</p>
               <p>But if it was a meer Spiritual Malady, or a Diabolical Poſſeſſion, and Sin the immediate Cauſe thereof, as Judicious Conſcientious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are unprejudic'd, and unbiaſſed, do judg; then the only Means muſt be Spiritual, and the Bleſſing which follows, muſt needs be Supernatural. So in that caſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.21. all other means are excluded. Yea, tho that Demoniack was a Lunatick,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Dr.</hi> Stillingſt. <hi>his opinions as to this, in his</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Sacr. <hi>pag.</hi> 263.</note> as appears by <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.39. compared: The Devil taking advantage by his Lunacy, to get Poſſeſſion of him, as we call Melancholy, <hi>Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum Diaboli.</hi> In this caſe there was not ſo much as Melancholy Lunacy, nor any ſuch bodily Malady, as we ſuppoſe, to be the Evil Spirit's Vehicle, into <hi>D</hi>'s Body, that Phyſical Means ſhould carry it out; he being of an healthful Conſtitution before theſe Fits begun with him. <hi>Corporeal things have no direct Phyſical Influence on Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirits,</hi> as Mr. <hi>.</hi> obſerves.</p>
               <p>Even in caſe of immediate Diſpoſſeſſions by our Bleſſed Saviour, they imputed them unto wrong Cauſes: Let not us run into the ſame Error.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:57247:25"/>
               <p>If the Malady was complicated, <hi>viz,</hi> in part Supernatural, and in part Natural, that being cauſal of this, and this being conſeqen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial of that: Then both ſorts of Means muſt be acknowledged in their ſeveral places: Yet muſt Spiritual Means have the Precedency, as having moſt of God in them; tho Phyſical Means are not to be neglected, or deſpiſed. So in thoſe Caſes, <hi>Job</hi> 33.14. to 31. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14, 15, 16. It's evident that the young Man was ſomething diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his Body, by his ſtrange Fits: It's a wonder that his Body was no more diſtempered. He needed Phyſical Medicines to open, and eaſe his Body, being adviſed thereto, he made uſe of Mr. <hi>Chew,</hi> whom he had formerly, without ſucceſs, applied himſelf unto: His Medicines were now uſed, and bleſſed, to the ſaid purpoſes. We dare not ſlight the Bodily Mercy, nor the Phyſical Means, but would own each in their place, giving all the Glory to God, whoever were the Inſtruments, whatever were the Means. What a diſturbance, and diſtraction, would it have been to all about him, if he had not been delivered.</p>
               <p>After all this, we are too tim'rous acknowledging, this ſignal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Prayers, and too backward in ſolemn Thankſgiving for ſuch a deliverance: Inſomuch as it is alſo a Reformation of the young Man in ſeveral things: O that we could ſay in every thing! Yet is he now more devout in his way, and of the more ſober ſort among his Neighbours, as they themſelves confeſs.</p>
               <p>As to ſome others alas! They will not believe, tho they ſee ſo many Signs and Wonders in this Age of Wonders. It's well if it happen not to them, that as Deſpiſers they wonder, and periſh; the Lord working a work in their Day, a work which they ſhall in no wiſe believe, tho a Man declare it unto them. If they be a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, yet they ſit down in more ſecurity, either in their Senſuality or Formality. Tho others regard not the Works of the Lord, nor conſider the Operations of his Hands: Yet the Wiſe ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his works, and walk in his ways. Not being ſcandalized at others ridiculing this; ſeeing Men dare to deal ſo now a-days with the great Truths, and Things of God.</p>

                     <hi>THomas Dugdale,</hi> Father of the ſaid <hi>Richard Dugdale,</hi> maketh Oath, that he conſulted one <hi>Crabtree,</hi> in behalf of his ſaid Son, then under a ſtrange Diſtemper, and had his Anſwer; that if there was Money enough he could effect the Cure: whereupon this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſeeing his Sons Body much weakned with the ſaid <hi>Crabtree</hi>'s Phyſick, and his Fits more violent, did apply himſelf to Mr. <hi>Jolly</hi> a Neighbouring Miniſter, and others of his Brethren in the Miniſtry. And this Deponent ſaith, he hath ſeen his Son vomit up Stones ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, and other things. Once he declared, he muſt either vomit Gold, Silver, or Braſs Rings, and an Hair Button, and accordingly he did ſo. At other times he vomited great Stones, alſo blew Stones like Flints. One time he vomited a Stone as was an Inch and an half long, and an Inch and an half broad, having Blood upon the edges, which this Deponent and others ſtanding by him apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was very painful to him. And further this Deponent maketh Oath, that one day a little before Night, walking by his ſaid Son then in a Fit, it growing dark, a Candle being brought in, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent looking upon him, there was a great Stone laid upon his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, weighing about Twelve or Thirteen Pounds, this Deponent not knowing how it came there, nor was there any ſuch like Stones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Houſe. Beſides Stones have been thrown at the Barn ſide, falling very thick upon the Door, yet this Deponent could never diſcover the hand which threw them, nor any Perſon imploy'd therein, altho this Deponent's Wife was hit with one of them, but without any Rurt. At other times the ſaid <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> would caſt Gooſe-dung at this Deponent, and others ſtanding by, which he ſeem'd to fetch out of the Barn ſide; altho neither this Deponent, nor thoſe that were with him could find any there, nor diſcover any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57247:26"/>one that brought it, nor were there any Geeſe kept at the Houſe, nor other Geeſe came near it. And Laſtly, This Deponent ſaith, that his ſaid Son would run upon his Hands, and his Feet together, as faſt as moſt Men could run upon their Feet alone, and his Body would ſometimes be ſo heavy, that two or three ſtrong Men could hardly lift it up, at other times as light as a Bag of Feathers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Walmſly</hi> of <hi>Harwood</hi> in the ſaid County of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; Depoſeth, That he hath ſeen the ſaid <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> in a Fit held in a Chair by ſix Men. And whilſt his Feet were off the ground, he hath leaped up in the Chair for two or three Hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as faſt as a Man can ordinarily count any thing; and hath ſo ſweated through his Cloaths, that it hath ſtood like a Dew upon them. Moreover this Deponent, hath taken the ſaid <hi>Richard Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> by his Shoe, betwixt this Deponents formoſt Finger, and his Thumb, another taking him at his Head, and ſo lifting him up, this Deponent could not think he weighed ſix Pounds. And farther, this Deponent faith, that Mr. <hi>Jolly</hi> the Miniſter, ſending word by him to the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi>'s Father, that the Miniſters would be at his Houſe called <hi>Surey</hi> on ſuch a day; this Deponent going the ſame day he was ſpoken to with his Errand, the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> declared it before this Deponent mentioned it, as likewiſe what Miniſters would be there. And furthermore, this Deponent upon his Oath ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> in ſome of his Fits, opening his Hand hath received written papers into it, none of the By-ſtanders knowing how they came thither. Which the ſaid <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> had given People that were about him, alſo the ſaid Deponent hath ſeen him ſhuffle Ruſhes like Cards, and play Games on them, as tho' he had been playing with ſome other Perſon, with whom he hath chid about the Caſts, curſing and ſwearing in his Play, and then ſaid, <hi>Do not Gameſters thus.</hi> He likewiſe play'd with Ruſhes as tho' they had been Dice, uſing exactly ſeveral Expreſſions belonging to that Play; ſaying, <hi>People think this is laid on me for my Sins, But I never was a Gameſter in my Life, neither know I how to play at ſuch Games, when out of my Fits.</hi> And the ſaid <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> did likewiſe play at Bowls, making Bowls of Ruſhes, and when he had thrown the Jack, he ſaid, <hi>I muſt now throw my Gill,</hi> then running a good way, as tho he had been running after a Bowl, ſwearing, <hi>Run, run, Flee, flee, bold a Byaſs;</hi> and ſometimes he catcht up Ruſhes, as tho'they had been Bowls, ſwearing, <hi>Sirrab, ſtandout of the way, or I'll knock out your Brains;</hi> adding, <hi>I never was a Bowter, but dont Gentlemen do thus.</hi> And this Deponent ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> had ſeveral Fits, after his being threatned with being brought before a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57247:26"/>Juſtice of Peace. And once being in his laſt Fit, when this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent was preſent, he declared his Affliction was through Obſeſſion, and in a Combination which ſhould never be diſcovered, whilſt the World endured. And this Deponent hath ſeen him in a Fit, as in a great Agony, with ſomething he could not ſee, and then hath been taken up, and thrown backwards, ſet upon his Head, and ſo ſtood till he was pulled down by one <hi>John Fletcher.</hi> Alſo this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent hath heard him Curſe and Swear, his Geſture being ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it would have frighted a Man to come near him, and yet in a Moments time after in ſuch a fear, that he hath ſought to creep into any hole, or behind any body, to have hid himſelf, and ſo lamented himſelf, as moved the Standers-by with great Compaſſion. He would at other times have told when his Fits would begin, when they were two or three in one day, or three or four days aſunder, wherein he was never diſproved, that he knows of; which Fits commonly began with the Calf of his Leg, and wrought upward into the Cheſt of his Body, and then he was thrown down, where he would lie for a good while as dead, or breathleſs, and then would have a ſtrange noiſe in his Mouth, and Noſe, and there would be in his Boſom like Whelps before he had riſen, after which ſometime he would be very furious, ſometimes more quiet.</p>

The ſecond Reaſon was, the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we were at, for it coſt us more than three Pound ten Shillings, in little time more than three Weeks; which was inſupportable, conſidering our Indigency, and no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging ſings of help; but the Doctors words to his Neighbours, were at firſt, that if the Father would bring Money enough he would cure <hi>Richard Dugdale,</hi> yet ſaid another time, if the Spirit in <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> was a Water-Spirit, there was no cure for it. Some time after we conſulted Mr. <hi>Jolly,</hi> who with others in the Miniſtry upon our Requeſt were much concerned for <hi>Richard Dugdale,</hi> praying for him near twelve Months; in which time he had many ſtrange Fits, ſometimes vomited Stones, a Curtain-Ring, a large Hair-Button; in Fits would be lighter than ſo many Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. In the beginning of ſeveral Fits, would gape and catch with his Mouth (as a Dog at Flies) ten or eleven times together; in the end open'd his Mouth ſo oft; when we thought Spirits might come into him, and in the end leave him. In many of his laſt Fits, he told People he might be killed or cured before the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> which prov'd true; for on the <hi>24th</hi> coming from his work on <hi>Hinfield</hi>-ſide, his laſt Fit ſeiz'd him, when he came home he was in the Fit; his Face black as a Coal: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he fell down, lay a while, then recover'd out of his laſt Fit: After this <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Dugdale</hi> had no Fit; tho once, when he had got too much Drink, he was after another manner than drunken Perſons uſually are.</p>

                        <p>Further, That a certain Perſon going to ſee <hi>Richard Dugdale,</hi> took ſome Bisket, and a piece or pieces of Gold, on purpoſe, as the Perſon ſaid, to try whether <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> could diſcover it. Soon after the Party came to the <hi>Surey,</hi> the Relator ſaw the Perſon ſtanding upon a Seat to take a fuller view of <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> in his Fit. <hi>Richard Dagdale</hi> immediately treated her ſo very rudely, diſcover'd the Bisket, and ſaid, <hi>I will play at Cards with thee for thoſe Guineas in thy Pocket,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe words the Relator heard <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> ſpeak in his Fit; further, that <hi>John Fielding</hi> Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, related in the hearing of the ſaid <hi>Nathaniel Waddington,</hi> and others, that he, the ſaid <hi>John Fielding</hi> was working at his Calling, above thirty Miles diſtant from the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey;</hi> and that <hi>Richard Dugdale,</hi> in one of his Fits ſaid, <hi>John Fielding is this day at ſuch a place working;</hi> and further named the piece of work which he had in hand at that time. The ſaid <hi>John Fielding,</hi> coming over to ſee his Relations, ſeveral Perſons who had heard <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> ſpeak thoſe words, and relate ſuch ſtrange Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, came to the ſaid <hi>John Fielding,</hi> to know whether it were true; this he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; being much ſurprizd at their Relation. Thirdly, That he asked this <hi>Richard Dugdale,</hi> when he came out of his Fits, whether he could give account of any thing that paſt in the Fit; this <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> denied, only once related a ſtrange Paſſage, that in his Fit he thought he had diſtinct ſight of a Perſon, and told the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he thought he ſaw him in; and the place where; many Miles from the place where <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> had his Fit: Which things concerning that Perſon were found ture upon enquiry.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nathaniel Waddington</hi> further teſtifies; That <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> in his Fits, would ſometimes pretend that a good Spirit was in him, and that <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> then, would in a long diſcourſe ſpeak againſt ſeveral Sins, <hi>viz.</hi> Drinking, Gaming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bringing ſeveral pat Scriptures, naming Book, Chapter, Verſe, either whole or part, ſo much as was pertinent. Mr. <hi>John Grimſhaw</hi> examin'd the places, and found them true, and that <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> in his Diſcourſe would uſe many pretty Similitudes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Joſeph Hargreves,</hi> Neighbour to <hi>Nathaniel Waddington,</hi> teſtifies; That coming to the <hi>Surey,</hi> and finding the Boy laid on the Barn Boor; he, the ſaid <hi>Joſeph Hargreaves,</hi> lifted <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> from the Ground more than once; and thinks (ſpeaking to the ſall) that <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> did not weigh aboves Stone and a half: Further that ſix ſtrong Men could not hold him in a Fit, but that he hath drawn them all a great way, and been forced from amongſt them, hanging upon him at a Table a Yard high, that he ſaw the Lump upon his Legabout the bigneſs of a Turkey Egg, riſe towards his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that he, and others have endeavoured to ſtop it, by girding a Boot-Garter above it, under the Knee, and by graſping that part with their hands, yet could not prevent its riſing into the Cheſt of his Body; that this, to his thinking, crep up his Leg like a Rat, ſometimes in motion, at times would be at a ſtand. <hi>Joſeph Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaves</hi> teſtifies the firſt, and third, of <hi>Nathaniel Waddington. Richard Crichly</hi> under his hand teſtifies, concerning <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi>'s Strength.</p>

                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and begged leave of his ſaid Maſter, to go to a Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to <hi>Whalley,</hi> and being in Drink, fell out at <hi>Whalley</hi> with a Man, and fought about dancing that Night. (He ſays) afterwards he went to his Farthers Houſe: The day afterwards he went from his Fathers Houſe, to <hi>Arnald's bigging,</hi> and on the Road, being troubled in Mind, he thought that he ſaw ſeveral Apparitions, but could not tell the reſemblance thereof. The day afterwards, he ſays, he went to make Hay, and found himſelf clogged with ſome heavineſs, that he could not work, or ſtoop; from thence, he weut to a Well about a Fields breadth from the Hall afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57247:31"/>and ſaw a Gallon, or Pale, ſtanding at the Well, and that he laid himſelf down to drink at the Well, and as he was drinking, there came up to him, a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of good Repute, and adviſed him not to drink ſo much Water, but rather go up to the ſaid Hall, and get drink, and told him that ſo much Water was enough to ruin him; and ſays that he took her advice, and went up to the ſaid Hall, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome Drink from the Cook-Maid, he went up into his Chamber, and after ſome time being laid down upon the Bed, the Chamber-Door opened of it ſelf, as he thought, and there appeared unto him ſomething like a Smoke, or Miſt, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vaniſhed, and afterwards there came partly a fear upon him. Immedtately after he thought there came unto him, the likeneſs of a Hard-favoured Man, which at that time he thought had been one <hi>Hindle,</hi> a Fellow Servant, whoſe Hair ſeemed to be clipped cloſe to his Ears, and lay very heavy upon his Breaſt, inſomuch that he asked him what he would do with him, which ſuddenly after ſpeaking, he thought the Viſion turned into the likeneſs of a naked Child; he ſays, he thought that he got hold of the naked Child by the Knee, and that the Child turned into the likeneſs of a Filmert, and went away with a ſhrill Scriek: All this was done when he was awake, as he is now to his thinking. Immediately after this, he ſays, that he was very rude, and troubleſome, inſomuch that two Women could ſcarce hold him, and that he raved of one Dr. <hi>Chew,</hi> and deſired the Woman to ſend for his Unkle, to go with him to the ſaid Doctor; who was the firſt, and laſt Phyſician he had Phyſick from. He ſays, to the beſt of his knowledg, he thought he had little advantage by the firſt Phyſick, but whether he took all or no, he cannot tell. After the firſt time of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Phyſick from Dr. <hi>Chew,</hi> he went to one Dr.<hi>Crabtree;</hi> and the ſaid Doctor blooded him ſeveral times, the firſt of which was as black as Ink, and that Blood was got with very great difficulty. Afterwards he went to Dr. <hi>Crabtree</hi> a ſecond time, and was blooded, and took Phyſick as before, and whilſt he was with Dr. <hi>Crabtree,</hi> he ſays he was for ſome two or three days, and ſometimes a Fortnight without any Fit, and ſometimes two or three Fits of a day. He ſays, his Senſes were ſometimes taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him in his Fits. He ſays, ſometimes he could remember ſome Paſſages. Aff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he believes one <hi>Robert Martin</hi> adviſed his, the ſaid <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Father, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe his Son to apply himſelf to one Mr. <hi>Jolly,</hi> to deſire his prayers, where he fell into a Fit, but remembers no diſcourſe he had with Mr. <hi>Jolly.</hi> He the ſaid <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> ſays, he believes he was not poſſeſſed with an Evil Spirit. And ſays likewiſe, that he had a Fit on the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> at Evening, and on the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> in the Morning, he took Phyſick from Dr. <hi>Chew,</hi> and ſays, that the Phyſick worked well with him, and ſince that time, he ſays, he never had any Fit: But ſays, that the ſtrange things that befel him, occaſions him to believe that the Diſeaſe was not ordinary. And likewiſe ſays, that he was not in any Combination with any Perſon, or Perſons whatſoever, and that there was no Cheat, in any thing, to his knowledg. He further confeſſeth, that to his knowledg, he cannot remember that he could play any more Tricks than the reſt of the School-Boys, and he denys that he ever ſpoke any ſuch things as are laid to his charge, to the School-Maſter about the Monies, and ſays, that he is no Latin Schollar, not knows any of thoſe Sentences charged upon him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by heart, or otherwiſe. He ſays, he did write a Letter to Sir <hi>Edmund Aſhtou,</hi> but remembers no Latin Sentence therein. He ſays likewiſe, he never wrapped himſelf in a Blanket, in order to fright any Perſon. He ſays likewiſe, that after the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters left <hi>Surey,</hi> that he had not Fits ſo often as before; but they were more violent than ever before.</p>

                  <head>Concerning <hi>R. D.</hi> his Teſtimony.</head>
                  <p>It ſhould not ſeem ſtrange, that he doth not mention ſeveral Particulars mentioned in the Narrative; particularly about the beginning of his Fits; and when we began with him; and when we left of meeting at <hi>Surey;</hi> and when his Fits left him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for he might eaſily forget the ſaid Paſſages in 7 or 8 years time, or be ſtreightned by the preſence and influence of ſome there preſent: but ſome of us did note down the ſaid omitted Paſſages all along, and can ſatuſy any ſober Perſon, that it was all ſo, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſaid Narrative. He did declare ſuch things to us, and deſire ſuch things of us from firſt to laſt.</p>
                  <p>Neither ſhould it ſeem ſtrange, that he doth not expreſly own the true Cauſe of his ſaid ſtrange Fits, nor the only proper Means of his Deliverance (tho' he hath freely owned both more privately, and under his own Hand): For be is apparently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by thoſe, on whom he hath his dependance, as to his Livelihood, and by his Neighbours; alledging in his Excuſe, <hi>that he is a poor Man, hath a Wife and four ſmall Children:</hi> A ſemptation, that might put a ſtrong Chriſtian to it to conquer it.</p>
                  <p>Yet doth he, by the aforeſaid Information, fairly overturn Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Foundations, for he owns himſelf ſound in Body and Mind, when theſe ſtrange Fits firſt ſeized him, and diſowns them as any ordinary Diſeaſe: and tho' in his Information, he ſaith, he believes he was not poſſeſſed with an evil Spirit, he is partly to be excuſed, becauſe he himſelf little knew how he was in the ſaid Fits; but when he heard how it was with him therein from others, and conſidered of it, he did acknowledg that his ſaid ſtrange Fits were cauſed by the Devil: So I think muſt any one who exerciſeth his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who is not blinded with Paſſion, or Partiality, where <hi>ſtat pro ratione voluntas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He doth <hi>ſolemnly diſown ary thing of a Cheat, or Combination</hi> (that he knows of) <hi>in the Caſe,</hi> as his Father alſo doth; ſo that if it be not any ordinary Diſeaſe, nor Cheat, nor Combination, what muſt it then be? and what muſt then follow? Eſpecially when all the Informations are well weighed (which now will need fewer Grains of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than formerly): Now let all ſober Perſons judg of the Malady, and Remedy.</p>
                  <p>In that the Informations both private and publick are called over again before Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it is to take away all occaſion of ſuſpicion, as to any unfair dealing. In that there is ſome diſſerence (tho' not much material) from what is in the printed Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: I cannot yet learn how the Miſtake was; but the owning of this ſhews the Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Parties concerned: And amends is abundantly made by the conſiderable additions, and the authentickneſs of all.</p>

                  <p>I have heard <hi>R. D.</hi> in his Fit ſay, <hi>that he had a Familiar, elſehow ſhould I tell ſuch things as I do?</hi> I have ſeen <hi>R.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his Arm, or Fingers. And when it was reported that Mr. <hi>Braddill</hi> would ſend him to the Houſe of Correction, I have ſeen <hi>R. D.</hi> in a Fit ſcorn towards him by calling, <hi>John, John,) come you muſt make a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> I will ſend him away,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Merk.</note> (or words to this purpoſe) then he would have caſt up his Shoulder like Mr. <hi>Edleſton,</hi> and made as tho' he would have written with his Finger in the Ball of his Hand with ſcornful Laughters. I have ſeen him in his Fits at Mr. <hi>Walmſly</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Cronbock</hi>'s, and Mr. Braddili's,</hi> ſo that any of them might have ſeen him for coming forth. They at <hi>Surey</hi> have come for us, to our houſe to aſſiſt them; and we have gone, and <hi>Robert Turner</hi> along with us, and taken Ropes and tied them about <hi>R. D'</hi>s Middle. <hi>Robert Turner</hi> hath gone to the Hedg to get a Stake, to beat him with, but <hi>R. D.</hi> hath ſo made to him, that he hath broken, or ſhpt the Rope, ſo that we have been forced to lay hold of him. And <hi>Robert Truner</hi> hath been ſatisfied that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57247:32"/>contending with him would do no good, beſides I have ſeen <hi>D.</hi> make towards <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Turner,</hi> when in a Fit, and offer to pull the Skale-boos down to come to him, and that <hi>Robert Turner</hi> hath gone back, leſt he ſhould have gotten hold of him, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could perceive that <hi>R. Dugdale</hi> either regarded Perſons, or Place, where ever he was. I have ſeen him likewiſe have his Arms about his Neck, and they have been ſo faſt, that no one could pull them aſunder, till opened of themſelves. I likewiſe once came behind him, when he was dancing, and pick'd him off the place where he was, and he turned at me again, and his Father offered to help me, but he threw him down, as faſt as he could riſe, and <hi>R. D.</hi> then got hold of my hair, and there were 5 or 6 young Men preſent, which did there endeavour to help me, but they all could not ſo much as open a Finger of <hi>D</hi>'s Hand, but he held me there, till his Fingers open'd of themſelves: I likewiſe put up my hand to open his Fingers, but found that I could do no good, to my thinking, I might as well have offered to have broken a Bar of Iron. I verily think that it was no Cheat of <hi>Dugdale.</hi> As to hearing his Voice, I told Mr. <hi>Braddill</hi> it was betwixt the <hi>Surey,</hi> and <hi>Mill-Lane-Head,</hi> which he, and Mr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> took to be a Mile and an half; but I have enquired of Neighbours ſince, and we concluded it to be two Miles. Beſides, <hi>Surey</hi> ſtands in a bottom, and I do be lieve, any unbias'd Man cannot but think, that one might have heard him four Miles another way, as well as that two: For <hi>Surey</hi> ſtands cloſe to a lough River, which makes a great noiſe: Beſides Woods, and all againſt the Hand. As to the Leather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bottle Mr. <hi>T.</hi> charges me with, I utterly deny it. For I never carried Leather-Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Wooden Bottle, Stone or Glaſe-Bottle, or any other Bottle, or Veſſel, to the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi> either before that time, or at that time, or ſince, my Father, Mother, Brother, Siſters when called, will be ready to reſtify this. As to <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s School-Tricks, I learned when he did, I believe three or four Years, and I never ſaw, or heard, ſuch things as <hi>Edward Slaytor</hi> doth relate.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57247:34"/>was making Hay: Whereupon he came into the ſaid Hall, and laid himſelf down upon a Bed, according to the Advice of a Servant there: Then he ſaid, that 5 or 6 Evil Spirits appeared to him; and then the appearance of a Black Man did grin at him, and preſſed very fore upon him: Then both the Spirits and the Man danced upon the Floor, and then vaniſhed in a flame of Fire.</p>
                        <p>She alſo teſtifies, that at a certain time, when a Fit was coming on him at <hi>Morton,</hi> he fell a dancing and roreing hidiouſly: Then he fell to the Ground, and had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing riſing under his Clothes, as if it were quick; and that it begun in the very part of his Body, where (as he ſaid) that grim Man did preſs him ſore, at the firſt: Alſo, that whilſt he lay in the ſaid Fit, he did ſo ſweat, that one might wipe the Sweat off his Clothes; and all the Flaggs under him were wet therewith: She alſo teſtifies, that ſhe oft ſaw <hi>R.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57247:35"/>with a loud Voice, ſaid many times over. <hi>O thou,</hi> crying <hi>Jolly, thou ſhalt never caſt me out.</hi> In the ſame Fit, the ſald <hi>D.</hi> cryed out, <hi>O Carlile, Carlile, Carlile,</hi> (ſo he call'd Mr. <hi>Carrington.</hi>) After this, as Mr. <hi>Jolly</hi> was ending his Prayer, and was ready to diſmiſs the Aſſembly, Mr. <hi>Carrington</hi> came to the Barn door; where kneeling down, he pull'd out a little Bible, and looking in the ſame, <hi>D.</hi> cryed out ſeveral times, <hi>Carlile, read upon the Wall.</hi> Mr. <hi>Jolly,</hi> and the other Miniſters, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Carrington,</hi> deſired him to go to Prayer.

                        <p>At Night <hi>Mr. Jolly, Mr. Waddington,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Carrington,</hi> examin'd <hi>D.</hi> whether he had made any Contract with Satan, or no, either by writing, word, or any other way: To which <hi>D.</hi> anſwer'd, that there was no ſuch Contract that he knew of. Whereupon the Miniſters told him, that if he had made any Contract, or Bargain, with the Devil, they could not help him, unleſs he would firſt make an ingenuous Conſeſſion. <hi>D'</hi>s Mother upon this, with ſeeming earneſineſs ſaid, I pray thee <hi>Richard,</hi> it thou have made any Contaact, or Bargain, conſeſs it: Thou had better conſeſs it now. To which <hi>Richard</hi> anſwered ſomewhat faintly, I know of none. Mr. <hi>Jolly</hi> asked <hi>D.</hi> how can'ſt thou then anſwer ſeveral queſtions, and tell many things, which cannot be done by Lawful Art; thou having ſeemingly whiſper'd with ſomething at an Hole, or Corner in the Barn? Mr. <hi>Jolly</hi> ſaid further, how could 'ſt thou name thoſe Perſons, that came from <hi>Haſlingden,</hi> and tell them at what Ale-houſe they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and how much they drank, out of what Veſſels, Cans or Cups, what every one paid, whether Silver, half Pennies, or Farthings, and how many of each; and ſo particularly what change was return'd to any of the Company? to this <hi>D.</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he could not tell any of theſe out of his Fit: But in his Fit (it ſeem'd) he going to the aforeſaid hole, or place in the Barn, a Voice declar'd to him all the Anſwers, proper to the ſeveral Queſtions, which had been ask'd him: And further told him what things had been done by the Perſons aforeſaid, at a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from <hi>Surey.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Likewiſe the Miniſters examin'd <hi>D.</hi> about an Elephant-hafted Knife, which was found in his Mouth in a Fit, how he came by it? <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſaid he could not tell.</p>
                        <p>Another time, when I came to ſee <hi>D.</hi> I found him out of his Fit, and entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſcurce with him, he told me how his Fits began with him at firſt: Divers then preſent alſo told me, that ſtill in his foregoing Fit, his Spirit foretold when his next Fit ſhould come, and how long it ſhould continue. I ask'd how he knew when his Fit began? <hi>D.</hi> ſaid, ſtill when my Fit begins, I looſe my fight: Yet to my think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Old Man in a black Mantle appears in the beginning of my Fit, and goes before me over the Green, and leads ſtraightway into the Barn, if I be not there before; and I cannot but tollow him. At the end of this diſcourſe, <hi>D.</hi> did very ſuddenly riſe up from his Seat in the Houſe, and went into the Barn, there he fell flat upon his Back: When he had lain a while, he was turned on his Belly; as he lay, ſomething in the Calf of his Leg leap'd up very oft. Upon this I took his Leg betwixt my hands, yet ſtill it leap'd and ſprinted, as if I had a two-penny Chicken in my hands: And this when I ſtrove to hold it down. After this he was turned on his Pack again, ſtill I perceiv'd that leaping in the Calf of his Leg, and it jutted out as far as his Stocking could ſtretch. This after ſome time roſe up, and went up his Thigh to his Breaſt, and as it went along, it thruſt up his Clothes the height of ones Fiſt: This Lump roſe as far as the Collar of his Doublet, and then (cho' at other times his Face, and Neck,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57247:35"/>were of a white, or pale colour) his Neck and Face were as red as Blood: I could not ſee any Eyes that he had, but the holes were the ſame colour with his Face. Upon this he was ſet on his Feet in a trice, without the natural uſe of Arms, and Legs, and without bending any part of his Body: As one raiſeth a Stick, or Board to an end, very nimbly; and then he went to the aforeſaid hole, at the end of the Barn, and laid his Mouth a while to the hole.</p>
                        <p>Soon after he turn'd him about to the Company, and reeling down the Barn, came to the Ring where he uſed to dance; he ſaid, I have a Meſſage to declare to you all. In the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians, chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Rejoice evermore.</hi> This Verſe he expounded very handſomly and ſeriouſly; ſhewing what it was to rejoice evermore, and in what way we muſt do it: He ſpoke to this Verſe a long while in good order, and words, and from other Scriptures prov'd what he ſaid: Yet when he had done, he fleeringly ſaid, <hi>but which of us doth ſo?</hi> Then he came to the <hi>17th verſe,</hi> and ſhew'd what it was <hi>to pray,</hi> and what <hi>to pray without ceaſing;</hi> and this as well as the former: Then ended it; ſaying, <hi>but which of us doth ſo?</hi> He alſo expounded the 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>verſes,</hi> and ended the Expoſition of every Verſe, with a <hi>But which of us doth ſo?</hi> And beſides that, at the end of the laſt ſaid, <hi>Ha! Ha!</hi> and then danced very cleverly.</p>
                        <p>After this, <hi>D.</hi> with his Hands and Arms drumm'd on his Side, and with that, and a Noiſe that he made in his Throat, any one, who had not ſeen or known his Faſhions, would have taken it to have been a Drum. I heard a Man there preſent, who had been in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſay, that <hi>D.</hi> did then beat a March exactly, which was uſed by the Iriſh, which he never heard in <hi>England.</hi> Then he danced again, after this fell flat on the Floor, and as he lay along, a luſty ſtrong Man who had been Fellow ſervant with <hi>D.</hi> came hectoring into the Barn, and ſaid, <hi>Come Dick, they ſay thou art poſſeſt;</hi> if thou be, <hi>I can get thee holpen; but I think thou art not, for thou waſt always a good Lad.</hi> This Fellow would needs ſhake Hands with <hi>D.</hi> and talk'd over him a long while; till being perſwaded, he ſate down at the Barn-ſide. Soon after <hi>D.</hi> leap'd up, and ran to the aforeſaid Hole; and as he turn'd him about, he call'd the Man by his Name, and ſaid, <hi>Art thou come to ſee me? Thou haſt got a Bottle of Ale in</hi> Whally, <hi>and haſt left thy Horſe there.</hi> The Man ſaid, <hi>If thou can tell that</hi> (Dick) <hi>thou art poſſeſt, and I can get thee help. D.</hi> ſaid further to him, <hi>Thou thinkeſt to have another when thou goes back, and a Wheat-cake, and I'll fill thy Wheat-cake with Sparrow-bills; and in ſuch a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Man after this was extream tame and quiet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>D.</hi> diſcover'd many things of ſeveral Perſons, particularly a Woman, who came from wards <hi>Burnly: D.</hi> came up to her, ſnook't and ſmelt at her, call'd her by her Name, and ſaid, <hi>O art thou there; thou got ſome Stone-fruit at ſuch a place,</hi> (which <hi>D.</hi> nam'd) <hi>as thou came, and thou intend'ſt to have more.</hi> The VVomam bluſh't and ſlipt away.</p>
                        <p>Then <hi>D.</hi> fell flat on the Earth again, and as he lay he began to draw himſelf on a Root, and then harred and barked like as any Maſtiff; a Maſtiff which then lay in the Cow-houſe, harred and barked fiercely at <hi>D.</hi> again; and had leapt at <hi>D.</hi> if ſome had not put him out. Much more I could have told of him: But, through diſtance of time, it is now ſlipt out of my Memory</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="April 29.1689."/> Upon the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1689, in the Morning, came <hi>Richard Dugdale</hi> to my Houſe, he deſiring the liberty, and I having granted it; he had ſignified his Mind to that purpoſe a quarter of a Year before: But the Meſſenger fail'd, to give me notice, until a day or two, before he come.</p>
               <p>He and his Relation that came along with him, gave ſuch an account of his Caſe, that I ſaw cauſe to ſuſpect he was poſſeſſed by an Evil Spirit; and I was further ſatisfied concering it, whilſt we were at Family-duty, at which he was preſent.</p>
               <p>The Fit did then ſeize on him, partly whilſt I was reading, and opening the word: But much worſe whilſt I was at prayer. His motions in his Fit were very ſtrange, particularly turning the ſight of his Eyes in ward, and ſo making him ſtark blind, whilſt his Eye-lids were open, with other motions preternatural. He had alſo ſuch ſtrong motions, as were above his natural Ability and Agility; but I was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that rage he was in, againſt the Ordinance of God, eſpecially then Chriſt was more ſolemnly named, and his condition was earneſtly commended to the Lord: Then he raged as if the Devil had been in his bodily Shape; tho' he manifeſted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Inclinations to the VVord and Prayer, when he was not in his Fit. And he was in health of Body to all outward appearance, at the ſaid time.</p>
               <p>Other Means he had uſed, both lawful and unlawful, ſo that Prayers, and Faſting ſeemed to be the proper and only Means in this caſe: Accordingly he deſired that we would keep a Day of Prayer on his behalf.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="May the 8th."/> Accordingly we met at the <hi>Sparth,</hi> upon the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> before we begun to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe (the Paſtor of another Society being preſent to aſſiſt in the work) we examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Parents and the young Man himſelf; as to the occaſion of the ſad Affliction they at that time confeſſed, that both Father and Son, were in drink at <hi>Whally</hi> Ruſh-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon the <hi>James-Tide</hi> before; that they then had a Scuffle with a young man, whom they ſuſpected, or his Partakers to be inſtrumental of his harm.</p>
               <p>VVe alſo enquired as to the means they had made uſe of already, and convinced them of the evil of ſome unlawful means they had made uſe of. One Inſtrument they had made uſe of, was mr. <hi>Crabtree.</hi> VVe alſo ſhewed them that theſe means we were about, were appointed by Chriſt in this caſe; and that they might hope for a Bleſſing in this way;<note place="margin">Pſa. 1.11. <hi>to</hi> 25.</note> they repenting of their Sins, and expecting Mercy in God's own way.

               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57247:36"/>
               <p>We then proceeded to the Word, and Prayer; the Scripture inſiſted on was <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>To turn them from the Power of Satan to God.</hi> The Power which Satan hath in particular, and in general, is matter of Lamentation and Supplication: The Lord rebuke Satan, and reſcue Sinners from his Power. He had two dreadful Fits in the time of the Exerciſe: he alſo conſeſſed ſeveral Appatitions he had upon the Riot at <hi>James-Tide,</hi> and Offers of Gold to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Sabbath he was quiet under the Ordinances all the while; another Sabbath he was extream rude all the while: He ordinarily attending at our Meeting under this Affliction.</p>
               <p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June."/> Our third Meeting, on his behalf, was at <hi>Surey:</hi> Becauſe of its Vicinity to <hi>Whally,</hi> we acquainted Mr. <hi>Jea</hi> the Vicar, with the occaſion, that he might take no offence. All the while the Evil Spirit did work in the Demoniack, yet it brake not out into a Fit; but afterward the Evil Spirit did hurry him in a moſt violent manner and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted more than ordinary Rage againſt Mr. <hi>waddington:</hi> And the Subject inſiſted on, was <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. <hi>The Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World:</hi> ſhewing the dark Regions where the Devil rules.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Surey,</hi> the place of the Parties Habitation, was recorded and certified accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law. Providence ſet us upon the publick Stage, that the thing might not be done in a Corner.</p>
               <p>On the following Sabbath there was yet a greater concourſe of People: Many came to ſee him, but heard ſomething which affected them withal: The Sermon being to ſhew, that many are under the Power of Sin and Satan, in a leſs ſenſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a more dangerous manner. We were without Diſtractions from the Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack all the while.</p>
               <p>Another Sabbath he was very ill, through all the time of the Exerciſe; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as I ſtood by him, he ſpurned at me with great violence, grinting and ſpitting at me in a ſtrange manner; but he hurt me not.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57247:37"/>it would be ſo. The Devil raged exceedingly at this Meeting; it may be the great Confluence of the People, on this occaſion enraged him the more; had not the Lord helpt us mightily, we had been run down by him. He play'd upon the younger Miniſters very ſore, until they got above him.</p>
               <p>At the Evil Spirit fill'd the Jews with Envy, contradicting, and blaſpheming, when they ſaw the Muleitudes flocking to hear the word of God: So in this caſe. Yet were not the People affrighted, but followed on: Yea, the Concourſe was ſtill greater.</p>
               <p>On the Sabbath following we were mereifully freed from Diſturbance by the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi> until the cloſe of the Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>We were in our place, at our work, we ſhould not hinder the People from coming, nor give place to the Devil; but the Lord was pleaſed, as he ſaw meet, to make him to give place to us,<note place="margin">Zech. 3. 2 Cor. 10.4, 5.</note> being met together in the Name of Chriſt.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July 25."/> Upon the <hi>25th</hi> Inſtant, we had another opportunity on this occaſion; the young Man was detain'd from us much of the time, by reaſon of ſeveral Trances he was in: The multitude of the People was very great, that it cauſed great Diſtraction, and Danger; alſo a Hay-loſt in the Barn being broken down, by the weight of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Yet was their (through God's ſpecial Providence) no further harm done: This Meeting was in <hi>Altham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We were forced many times to meet in Out houſes, the Crowds of the People being to very great;<note place="margin">Mat. 131.2.18, 20.</note> our Chappel alſo being rather at an outſide from the ordinary Congregation: We did for their eaſe ſometimes meet elſewhere, having Chriſt's exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and encouragement thereunto; all the places of meeing being laſo licenſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Auguſt 13."/> Again, at the ſame place, upon the <hi>13th</hi> Inſtant, then the Devil raged in the young Man exccedingly; diſcovering himſelf more then ever by the <hi>Demoniack</hi>'s diſcovery of ſeveral things in his Fus, which could not be diſcover'd, but by a Diabolical Means; that Subject <hi>John</hi> 16.8, 9, 10, 11. was ſeveral days inſiſted on there, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at our Lord's-day Meetings.</p>
               <p>In my anſence Mr. <hi>Waddington,</hi> and the reſt of our Society, had a day in <hi>Read,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Dugdale's</hi> account, tho' he was not preſent.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Septemb. 3."/> Upon the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> we again met at <hi>Shrey</hi> on young <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s account: As I went to the place of the meeting, he gave me notice by a little Paper, which he put into my Hand; that, as his Spirit told him in his Fit, he muſt be dumb, and deaf, whilſt we prayed; immediately upon his delivery of the Note to me, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came both dumb, and deaf, all the while that the Exerciſe continued. <hi>Note,</hi> That ſometimes, he did out of his Fit, tell what he heard, or ſaw in his Fit, being done at a great diſtance,<note place="margin">2 Kings 6.8. to 12.</note> at the ſame time: As the Prophet could by the means of good Angel, tell what was done at ſuch diſtance. But in ordinary, he, out of his Fit,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57247:37"/>did not know what happen'd in his Fit. We would deal plainly on the one Hand, as well as the other.</p>
               <p>We were but few to carry on the work, ſo that we continued not ſo long as at other times. They ſhew'd us at that time a large Button, and a Curtain-Ring: But eſpecially a large corner'd Stone: All which the young Man had vomited to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment of all. Alſo we had account of ſeveral Latin Words, and Phraſes, which he utter'd tho' he knew nothing of them; his natural and acquired Abilities being but ordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Septemb. 5."/> Upon the <hi>5th</hi> Inſtant, we met at the ſame place, upon the ſame occaſion. The Lord brought in more Miniſters for our help; and the Meeting was very full; Satan was chained up, and the <hi>Demoniack</hi> gave us not much Diſturbance.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Septemb. 10"/> We met at the ſame Place, in the ſame mauner, upon the <hi>10th</hi> Inſtant; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of People was great, tho' the Weather was very bad: Satan we filenced this Day alſo.

Had he not manifeſted himſelf free, and forward for our proceeding thus far, we ſhould have deſiſted before this: VVe had hereupon deſiſted, but that the Youth conſeſſed his Fault, and his Father beſought us to go on.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Septem. 26."/> On the <hi>26th</hi> Inſtant, we again met at the <hi>Surey,</hi> upon the ſame account: The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. <hi>O.

I thought it requiſit ay ſome hing alſo, as to our Call to the Work, and Conduct therein; as to the Caſe and preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances alſo. The Truth is, we were then in great doubt and diſtieſs; for as we are men ſubject to like Infirmities with others: So our Temprations were then more than ordinary. Inſomuch that we needed to look very narrowly inon the Caſe, our Courſe, and Carriage alſo. VVe had need to be ſatisfied from our ſelves, when we had ſo little ſatisfaction from others.</p>
               <p>Upon the deſire of young <hi>Dugdale,</hi> the Junior Miniſter of the Company ſtaid with him that Night. The Devil (it ſeemed) in the Demoniack ſtill did further declare, that there was ſuch a Contract; that the firſt hold he got him, was upon a vain Wiſh he had in he Abbey-hall, <hi>That he might evccel all others in Dancing:</hi> That the Contract was for 18 months. Out of his Fits he would conſeſs what a fancy he had to Dancing; and that he cou'd not refrain from Dancing, after the aforeſaid <hi>Jams-Tide</hi> was a Twelve month, that he danceth moſt artiſicially in his Fits we ſaw: Tho' he ſaith, and others teſtiſy, he could not dance at all beſore, nor then out of his Fits. The Youth out of his Fit, would not confeſs any thing of a Contract with the Devil that he knew of: But it's too probable that there was a Conſederacy;<note place="margin">At leaſt wt did thenſuſpect ſuch a thing.</note> becauſe the Devil was ſo ready to gratify him, not only in ſuch artiſicial dancing, but to tell many things which could not be known without ſuch helliſh help; yeathoſe diſcoveries being frequently, upon whiſpering with ſomething in a certain Corner. That it is the Devil which ſpeaks in him, ſeems very plain, ſpeaking ſtrange Langugges which the Youth never learned, and with another Voice than his own: Yea, with two Voices at once, and ſometimes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57247:38"/>ſpeaking when the Organs of Speech were nor made uſe of. Alſo his ſaying that he was God, and requiring to be worſhipped; yea uſing many ſuch VVords, and Geſtures, as are moſt dreadful; tho' the Youth can tell nothing of them, when the Fit is over: Yet at ſome other times in his Fits, he deelaimed much againſt the Sins of the Place, and Time.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="October 11."/> Upon the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> we again met at the <hi>Surey,</hi> in the ſame manner, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame account; the People ſtill flocked to the meeting very much, and many were much convinced, and wrought upon all along; the Lord working by, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Ordinance together: Being deſired, I ſtayed to ſee his Fitover, tho' that was till about &amp; of the Clock in the Evening; ſome of the time was ſpent in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, expounding, ſinging, and praying; the Youth was very attentive all the while, and at the cloſe of the Exerciſes, his Fit began, and laſted about an hour; in which Fit the Spirit ſaid <hi>that the young Man was his own;</hi> declining any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with me, and inſulting at Mr. <hi>Carrington's</hi> not appearing that Evening, as he had done the Night before: For then Mr. <hi>Carrington</hi> had baited the Evil Spirit ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently. His Language in his Fit ſeemed to me to be but a ſort of Gibberiſh, at that time, or he ſpake his words ſo thick that I could make nothing of them; there was a great multitude of People even in the Night, and they were very rude, ſo that ſome harm was done to the place, and to ſome Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="October 18."/> We met again at the <hi>Surey,</hi> on the <hi>18th</hi> Inſtant; the Crowd of People was very great tho' the Seaſon was very wet; it was ſome Diſtraction among our ſelves, that one of the Miniſters, whilſt he was praying, turned his Speech to Satan, as we thought; which ſome took to be an unwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In the cloſe he thanked us, and wiſhed us to go on in the ſame courſe.</p>
               <p>So that it ſeems altogether improbable by this, and ſeveral other Paſſager, that their was any ill Deſign, or Cheat, in the Party, or in his Parents: who' ſome have been apt to cnarge them to that purpoſe.

Indeed ſometimes his carriage under the Ordinances, and at other times, gave us ſome hopes towards a Change, as to his ſpiritual Stats; which would he much better to him, and ſo the more deſirable to us: Yet a partial Change as to that, and a perfect Cure as to his Body, are ſignal deſirable Mercies: As to our Repute in the World, what is that to ſome of us, who are ſo near our going out of this World?</p>
               <p>As he return'd from the Meeting, on the Lord's Day following, he had a Fit, in which, as ſome creaible Perſons ſaid, who were with him, he repented the Heads of the Sermon, and the Proofs withal. The rerurn of his Fits after many days of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance muſt needs much exeriſe us; but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3. to 8. was of good uſe to ſome of us in that caſe: Yea, we were as friſh to work, as at firſt, the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing us <hi>with freſh Cile</hi> of his good Spirit.<note place="margin">Pſal. 92.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In his Fit upon the day following, he told us of ſome Money to come, before the meſſenger came, by whom I ſent ſome for their Relief; the Family being taken of their Callings, put to Charge, and very much impoveriſh'd upon this occaſion.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Februay 6."/> Upon the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> we again met the <hi>Surey,</hi> upon the ſame account. I was then wholly faild by my Brethren, through their other occaſions, as I ſuppoſ; but the Lord he ped in aſi the Work: The Youth had been free from any cnſiderable Fit for a Fortnight; ſo that they ſeem'd to be wearing off. In his laſt Fit he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpake of things done at a diſtance; and at the ſame ime when a doing.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Feb. 20."/> Upon the <hi>20th</hi> Inſtant, there was again a more full meeting of Miniſters at <hi>Surey,</hi> upon the occaſion aforeſaid: Tho' the D'ſcouragements from many others were very great. I then finiſh'd that Diſcourſe upon 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3 At the cloſe of the Exerciſe, we found the Youth ſome what mroe ingenuous towards us, tho his Father bewrayed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57247:39"/>more Diſingenuity. The Youth took occaſion ro confeſs further to me, that after the aforeſaid drunken Fit, upon <hi>James-Tide</hi> was Twelve-month, and the Dancing Humour he was then in, he had the Apparition of a Man's Head, all along in the way as he went to <hi>Weſtby hall</hi> (as it's commonly call'd) the Week after. When he came thither, he wrought hard at the Hay, and was taken with an unuſual Merrineſs, in the Evening of the ſame Day: He made himſelf drunk again, as he confeſſed, and in his Drink he was tranſported into ſuch an heighth of Profaneneſs, as did aſtoniſh the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders: So that they did conclude the Devil had then ſome extraordinary Power over him. He alſo, as himſelf ſaid, had an Apparition of the Devil, pointing at ſomething he had lately done: So that then we concluded, that the Devil, in his Drink, drew him into a blind Conſent, and Compact, to ſarisfy his Curioſity, and Dancing Humour. He alſo confeſſed to me ſince, that when he had thought to confeſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpoſe, his Mouth was ſtopped, that he could not; and then he had a Check for confeſſing ſo much. Sometimes he refuſed to do what the Devil moved him to; and then it appeared, he was toſſed ſtrangely.</p>
               <p>Providence now ſeem'd to call us off from attending upon this <hi>Surey</hi>-Caſe, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; laying before us occaſions and opportunities of more publick Concernment: It ſeem'd alſo to take us off from meeting at that place, the Landlord thereof being ſtirr'd up againſt the Family there, becauſe of the harm to his Hedges thereby: So that if we had perſiſted in meeting there, it might be great prejudice to them; they having much dependance on him, as to their outward condition. In thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the Miniſters, and others, generally rather halting in their work alſo; as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> even when he prevail'd for the Bleſſing. The Lord was pleased to give ſome viſible Encouragement, as to a good iſſue of this Affair in ſome ſort: For upon the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> he had a moſt terrible Fit, and therein the Evil Spirit took it's leave of him: As it's ſaid by ſeveral Witneſſes, it left him with a ſtrange kind of vomiting, yet nothing viſible appearing. After that time he told me, he did not find that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working in his Body, as heretofore: So that he hoped he was deliver'd. I told him, tho' at preſent we did not meet at his Father's Houſe, as formerly, for the Reaſons aforementioned yet we did coutinually remember his Caſe, both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and publickly. He own'd the Spititual Means, as the means whereby he had this help, and deſired our continuing of the uſe thereof. He hath been altogether freed for many Weeks, (now Years) ſave that once he had ſome Threatnings again, as to a Fit, being then in Drink: This he was troubled for. He had cauſe to be troubled, remembring what advartage Satan got againſt him by that Sin, at firſt, dreading leaſt the unclean Spirit return, <hi>and his laſt Eſtate be worſe than the firſt, Luke</hi> 11. And the Lord ſmote him with his immediate Hand, which I endeavoured to ſet in with. Thus far are the Minutes in my Diary, as to this caſe.</p>
               <p>This ſhort account of the ſaid Affair, I thought meet to give becauſe the Impreſſion of the former Narrative is ſold off: Beſides the Reprinting of that at large, with this would make this too bulky, and ſo too coſtly for the ordinary ſort of Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Some ſuch account alſo ſeems neceſſary to thoſe, who have not ſeen the former Narrative: And indeed this was the firſt Draught, tho' it came forth laſt.</p>

            <p>The Worthy Author of theſe Papers, is not accountable for this delay; he having drawn up, a <hi>Vindication</hi> of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, ſo far as he was concerned therein ſeveral Months ago; and the Copy of theſe Sheets has been out of his Hands, with a deſign that they ſhould be ſpeedily print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for above theſe eight Months: But the expectation that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> would alſo draw up his Anſwer, to come forth with this, has been one Principal Reaſon hereof; together with the Author's great diſtance from the Preſs, that he could not ſo haſten it's publiſhing, as otherwiſe, he might.</p>
